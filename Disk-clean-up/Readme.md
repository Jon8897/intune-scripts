# Disk Cleanup Script

This script performs disk cleanup by removing unnecessary files from your system. It utilizes the DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) tool to perform the cleanup operations.

## Prerequisites

## Usage

1. Open PowerShell.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script by executing the following command: .\diskcleanup.ps1
4. Follow the on-screen prompts and wait for the disk cleanup to complete.
5. After the cleanup is finished, a log file will be created in your temporary directory with the name `DiskCleanup.log`. You can refer to this file for details about the cleanup operation.

## Cleanup Flags

The script uses the following cleanup flags to determine which files to remove. You can modify these flags in the script to customize the cleanup process according to your needs:
