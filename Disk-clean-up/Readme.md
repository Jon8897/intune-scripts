# Disk Cleanup Script

This script performs disk cleanup by removing unnecessary files from your system. It utilizes the DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) tool to perform the cleanup operations.

## Prerequisites

2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script by executing the following command: .\diskcleanup.ps1
4. Follow the on-screen prompts and wait for the disk cleanup to complete.
5. After the cleanup is finished, a log file will be created in your directory with the name `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\IntuneManagementExtension\Logs\DiskCleanup.log`. You can refer to this file for details about the cleanup operation.
